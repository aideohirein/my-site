For a little under a year now, I’ve been studying as much as I can about UX/UI, and completed a many different courses online, as well as attending many workshops. From this, I have a good knowledge of UX processes as well as learned some fun skills. I pride myself on the desire to constantly grow, learn and evolve my skills. Caused to this, I am keen to start my career with the industry.
