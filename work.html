	<h3 class="bike"> Overview: </h3>
	<ul><b> What I've learnt:</b>
	My use of colour is pleasing for family friendly sites, though I should have made an adult only site, I do feel that some colour would still be welcome. 
	Also the I think simplifying the site more would make it more appealing to adults. Also more of a feature of the Eco aspect/health benefits would have helped with the layout.
