	<h2 class="bike"> overview: </h2>
	<p>
	what i've learnt: my use of colour is pleasing for family friendly sites, though i should have made an adult only site, i do feel that some colour would still be welcome. 

	the main resons that people are wanting to cycle is to keep fit as well as help the environment.
