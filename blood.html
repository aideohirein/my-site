		Research and interviews 
		INTERVIEW
		5 interviews with a mix of people aged between 20 and 40, asking them what they thought of the userbilty of the site. 

		CATEGORIES
		From the interviews I’ve discovered that the main issues were the as follows:
		- The site was cold and too medical 
		- It didn’t invoke enough emotion from it’s user
		- That the general site was far too wordy
		- Site is awkward to use
		- The appointments were too far, (if you booked in Oct you may not get an appointment until Jan/Feb the next year)
