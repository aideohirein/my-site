	<h3> Overview:</h3>
	<p> 
	The old site has plenty of information, the only draw backs were the layout and userbility being hard for non computer literate people, as well as the forms being long and time consuming. 

	My update worked well at showcasing the already great content of the site, I think I achieved my aim in simplifying the site to aid the userbility.
