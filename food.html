	<p> <b>What I've learnt:</b>
	What I've learnt: The only way this app will actually work would be to have a deal with the restaurants in order for them to be compliant to what we are offering. Currently with from researching not all of the dietary information is available when searching on the websites/going to the most restaurants.
